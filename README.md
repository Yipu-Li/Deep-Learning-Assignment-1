## UvA Deep Learning 1 Assignments, 2024 edition

This is my code for Deep Learning assignment 1 2024 at Uva. Here we are supposed to train a neural network both by using Numpy from scratch and using the modules in pytorch for the data set Cifar10.

# assignment 1

In the assignment 1 folder you can find the codes I eveentually submitted, where the network as the following structure:
one layer, 128 hidden units, 10 epochs, optional batch normalization, learning rate 0.1, random seed 42.
I achieved the accuracy of 0.4673 without batch normalization and 0.4726 with batch. (See the file train_mlp_pytorch.py and the graphs attached)
